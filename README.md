## Quick Start
```shell
git@github.com:msimbo/fyi21-cy1-adzuna-play.git
cd fyi21-cy1-adzuna-play
yarn install # installs the needed files
yarn run dev # runs the app for you to try out
```

## Notes
- Added some fun elements. See line 24- 26 in `index.html`
- Carefully read the notes in the `app.js` files
- It's especially important to understand how we write the `searchJobs()` functions and how we eventually used it in `searchForm.addEventListener()` (this is the "magic" combo)
